## Task1
 Realize a Reinforcement Learning implementation of a self-learning BlackJack player in a program
ming language of your choice. This implementation provides the basis for the paper from Task P3.2.
 It shall learn optimal policies for at least the following scenarios:
 1. The Basic Strategy 
 2. The Complete Point-Count System 
 3. In addition to the basic rules, two rule variations of your choice shall be examined for their
 inuence on the strategies from (1.) and (2.).
 4. Consider improving the system from (2.) to be able to achieve higher pro ts on average.
 Note: Your system does not have to be suitable for humans. It may therefore be relatively
 complicated, e.g. with respect to card counting.
 What pro t can be expected for the di erent scenarios in a greedy evaluation of your approaches?
 The deliverable for this task is the commented source code of your implementation and all log
les that contributed to the results in Task P3.2. Do not use an external Reinforcement Learning
 framework
